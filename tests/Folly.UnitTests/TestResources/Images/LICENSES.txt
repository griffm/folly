## Images Included

### DPI Test Images
- `test-72dpi.jpg` - 100×100px JPEG at 72 DPI
- `test-96dpi.jpg` - 100×100px JPEG at 96 DPI
- `test-150dpi.jpg` - 100×100px JPEG at 150 DPI
- `test-300dpi.jpg` - 100×100px JPEG at 300 DPI
- `test-300dpi.png` - 100×100px PNG with pHYs chunk at 300 DPI
- `no-dpi-metadata.jpg` - 100×100px JPEG without DPI metadata

### CMYK and ICC Profile Test Images
- `test-cmyk.jpg` - 200×200px CMYK JPEG
- `jpeg-with-icc.jpg` - 200×200px RGB JPEG with embedded sRGB ICC profile
- `png-with-iccp.png` - 200×200px PNG with iCCP chunk
- `test-rgb.jpg` - 200×200px RGB JPEG without ICC profile

## Generation Method

These images were created using pure C# code with zero external dependencies:

1. **JPEG files**: Minimal valid JPEG structure with JFIF APP0 markers for DPI, Adobe APP14 markers for CMYK
2. **PNG files**: Valid PNG structure with pHYs chunks for DPI and iCCP chunks for ICC profiles
3. **Image content**: Simple solid color pixels (blue for RGB, varied for CMYK)
4. **ICC profiles**: Minimal sRGB ICC profile headers for testing

## Regenerating Images

To regenerate these test images:

```bash
cd tests/TestResourceGenerator
dotnet run
```

The generator will create all test images in this directory.

## Purpose

These images are used exclusively for unit testing DPI detection, CMYK color space handling, and ICC profile support in the Folly PDF library. They are intentionally minimal in size (~5 KB total) to keep the repository lightweight.
